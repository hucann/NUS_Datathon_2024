Unlike global imputation methods, KNN adapts to the distribution of the data and can handle both numerical and categorical features, making it versatile. This applies to our dataset with both numerical and categorical features. It is particularly effective in our dataset where relationships between variables are non-linear, and there is no assumption of normality in the data. The parameter tuning feature allows flexibility in choosing the number of neighbors, and it aims to preserve local relationships, making it suitable for datasets with non-random patterns of missing values. As detailed in the subsequent evaluation section, the choice of k = 5 yields the most effective imputation results and is thus selected.\n",

        "Several factors may be accountable: Firstly, Gradient Boosting Regressor is well-suited for tasks where non-linear relationships exist between features and the target variable. In the given scenario where the relationship between independent variables and sales is not strictly linear, Gradient Boosting Regressor's ability to build trees sequentially and correct errors helps capture these non-linear patterns, while Linear Regression assumes linearity and fails to capture non-linear relationships effectively. Secondly, Gradient Boosting Regressor is relatively robust to outliers and handles extreme values more effectively. This robustness can be crucial in countering fluctuations or anomalies in the dataset.\n",
        "Moreover, Multiple Linear Regression exhibited significantly worse performance compared to Gradient Boosting Regressor and Random forest Regressor, possibly due to its sensitivity to noise or non-linear relationships introduced by the KNN imputer. Both Gradient Boosting Regressor and Random forest Regressor are robust to missing data and can handle imputed values."
